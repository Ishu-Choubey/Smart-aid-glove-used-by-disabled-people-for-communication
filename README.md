# Smart-aid-glove-used-by-disabled-people-for-communication
It has been observed that disabled people like deaf and mute have hard time communicating and coping up with normal people due to their inability to speak. So, the only way in which they express their emotions or convey their thoughts is by using sign language, but in today’s world very few people understand sign language. Approximately 10% of the world’s population is mute or deaf, hence they use sign language as their primary language. Looking at their struggle to communicate led us to the idea of building this project. In this era of advancement, it is very essential to use our technology wisely and in a feasible way, such that it can help people of various stands in their daily life. This project involves a smart glove embedded with multiple flex sensors for precise figure bending or movement of fingers which will send data to microcontroller ARDUINO. The data thus obtained gets processed in microcontroller. Based on that, the hand sign language will be decoded using a predefined database. After this the output gets displayed in an on-board LCD display for the user to view and also gets transmitted in audio and text format to smartphone of the person user’s talking to.
